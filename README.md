## Why StudyMode?

As someone who gets easily distracted online, I found most existing Chrome extensions either too restrictive or inflexible. They often use:

- Hardcoded lists of websites
- Limited customization options
- Cluttered user interfaces

**StudyMode** was built to fix that. It’s a clean, no-frills tool that helps you get into deep focus mode.
